# 3D-Printing
Firstly, we processed the 3D model obtained through scanning using Autodesk meshmixer.

Then we import the obtained 3D model file into the 3D printer.

During the use of the printer, we encountered a problem: the printed material could not adhere well to the base plate, resulting in printing failure.

By asking the teacher, we learned that it was because the distance between the nozzle and the base plate was too far. After adjusting the height of the nozzle, the printing proceeded smoothly.

After about an hour of printing, we obtained a model of the thermos cup reduced to a quarter.
